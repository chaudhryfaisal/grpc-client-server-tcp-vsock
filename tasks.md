# gRPC High-Performance Client/Server Implementation Tasks

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Structure
- [x] Create Rust project with Cargo.toml configuration
- [x] Define minimal dependencies (tonic, prost, tokio, ring, log)
- [x] Set up proto definitions for echo and crypto services
- [x] Configure build.rs for proto compilation
- [x] Create basic project structure (src/lib.rs, src/bin/)

## Phase 2: Core gRPC Services
- [x] Add TCP transport support to server
- [x] Implement echo service proto definition
- [x] Implement crypto service proto definition
- [x] Create server binary with basic gRPC server setup
- [x] Implement echo service handler with logging
- [x] Add VSOCK transport support to server

## Phase 3: Cryptographic Services
- [ ] Implement RSA key generation at server startup (placeholder)
- [ ] Implement ECC key generation at server startup (placeholder)
- [ ] Create RSA signing service implementation (placeholder)
- [ ] Create ECC signing service implementation (placeholder)
- [ ] Add key type selection logic in crypto service

## Phase 4: Error Handling and Logging
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling (no panics/unwraps)
- [ ] Add logging crate integration with configurable levels
- [ ] Add detailed logging to echo service
- [ ] Add detailed logging to crypto service
- [ ] Add error propagation for all service methods

## Phase 5: Client Implementation
- [ ] Create client binary with basic gRPC client setup
- [ ] Implement echo service client calls
- [ ] Implement crypto service client calls with key selection
- [ ] Add TCP transport support to client
- [ ] Add VSOCK transport support to client
- [ ] Add proper error handling in client

## Phase 6: Testing
- [ ] Create end-to-end test function
- [ ] Add server startup in test
- [ ] Add echo service test calls
- [ ] Add RSA crypto service test calls
- [ ] Add ECC crypto service test calls
- [ ] Add proper test cleanup and resource management

## Phase 7: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement connection pooling for performance
- [ ] Add multi-threading support optimization
- [ ] Optimize for single and multiple connections
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and metrics

## Phase 8: Benchmark Implementation
- [ ] Create benchmark binary structure
- [ ] Add configurable connection count support
- [ ] Add configurable thread count support
- [ ] Add configurable request rate limiting
- [ ] Implement latency and throughput measurements
- [ ] Add benchmark result reporting

## Phase 9: Build System
- [ ] Create minimal Makefile
- [ ] Add build target
- [ ] Add test target
- [ ] Add run-server target
- [ ] Add run-client target
- [ ] Add benchmark target

## Phase 10: Final Integration and Testing
- [ ] Integration testing of all components
- [ ] Performance validation and tuning
- [ ] Code review and cleanup
- [ ] Documentation of usage and configuration
- [ ] Final validation of all requirements

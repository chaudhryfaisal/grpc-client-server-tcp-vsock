# Product Requirements Document (PRD): High-Performance gRPC Client/Server System

## Overview

Develop a high-performance, minimal latency gRPC client and server implementation in Rust supporting both TCP and VSOCK transports with cryptographic services.

## Objectives

- **Primary Goal**: Maximize performance and minimize latency for gRPC operations[1][2]
- **Secondary Goal**: Provide reliable cryptographic services via gRPC
- **Success Metrics**: Support high request rates with minimal CPU usage and sub-millisecond latencies

## Core Features

### Transport Support
- **TCP**: Standard network transport for remote connections
- **VSOCK**: Optimized for VM-to-host communication
- Connection pooling for performance optimization[3]

### gRPC Services

#### Echo Service
- **Functionality**: Log incoming payload and echo it back to client
- **Logging**: Detailed request/response logging with configurable levels[4][5]
- **Performance**: Minimal processing overhead for maximum throughput

#### Crypto Service
- **RSA Signing**: Support RSA signature generation using rust ring crate[6]
- **ECC Signing**: Support ECC signature generation using rust ring crate[7]
- **Key Management**: Server generates both RSA and ECC keys at startup
- **Client Control**: Client specifies key type and algorithm for each request

### Performance Requirements

- **Concurrency**: Support single and multiple gRPC connections[8]
- **Threading**: Optimized for single and multi-threaded scenarios[2]
- **Throughput**: Target 100K+ requests per second based on hardware capabilities[2]
- **Latency**: Sub-millisecond response times for echo operations

## Technical Requirements

### Error Handling
- **No Panics**: All operations must return proper error codes instead of panicking[9][10]
- **Error Propagation**: Errors should be returned to caller, never unwrapped
- **gRPC Status Codes**: Use appropriate gRPC status codes for different error conditions[10]

### Logging
- **Crate**: Use standard Rust logging crate for compatibility[4][5]
- **Levels**: Support configurable logging levels (trace, debug, info, warn, error)
- **Detail**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Performance**: Minimal impact on request processing performance

### Dependencies
- **Minimal**: Keep crate dependencies to absolute minimum for fast compilation
- **Features**: Only enable required dependency features
- **Optimization**: Prioritize compilation speed and runtime performance

## Implementation Structure

### Project Organization
- **Single Crate**: All components in one Rust crate
- **Multiple Binaries**: Separate client, server, and benchmark executables
- **Shared Code**: Common protocol definitions and utilities

### Binaries

#### Server Binary
- Launch gRPC server with both TCP and VSOCK support
- Generate RSA and ECC keys at startup
- Serve echo and crypto services
- Configurable logging levels

#### Client Binary
- Connect to server via TCP or VSOCK
- Support echo and crypto service calls
- Configurable key type selection
- Error handling and logging

#### Benchmark Binary
- **Configurable Connections**: Support multiple connection counts
- **Threading**: Single and multi-threaded benchmark modes
- **Request Rate**: Configurable requests per second
- **Metrics**: Latency, throughput, and error rate measurements

## Testing Requirements

### End-to-End Test
- **Single Function**: One comprehensive test function
- **Server Startup**: Launch server programmatically
- **Client Operations**: Test echo service functionality
- **Crypto Operations**: Test both RSA and ECC signing
- **Cleanup**: Proper resource cleanup after testing

### Build System
- **Makefile**: Minimal makefile with essential targets
- **Targets**: build, test, run-server, run-client, benchmark
- **Simplicity**: No complex build configurations or CI/CD

## Development Approach

### Implementation Priority
1. **Core gRPC Flow**: Basic client-server communication
2. **Services**: Echo and crypto service implementation
3. **Error Handling**: Robust error management
4. **Testing**: End-to-end functionality validation
5. **Benchmarking**: Performance measurement tools

### Quality Standards
- **No Placeholders**: All completed tasks must be fully functional
- **TODO Comments**: Detailed comments for future implementation items
- **Minimal Scope**: Only implement explicitly requested features
- **Performance Focus**: Optimize for speed and low latency[3]

## Success Criteria

- **Functional**: All services work end-to-end without errors
- **Performance**: Achieves target throughput and latency metrics
- **Reliability**: No panics or unwraps in production code
- **Maintainable**: Clean code structure with proper error handling
- **Testable**: Comprehensive test coverage for core functionality
